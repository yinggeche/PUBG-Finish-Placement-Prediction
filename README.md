Kaggle  Playground Code Competition
## Algorithm
Given two data sets, each of which consists of rows containing one playerâ€™s post-game stats, including kills, distances, boosts and heals. Except that, it also includes the final Win Place Percentage, which feature we need to predict. And if the win place percentage is more close to 1, it means this group has greater probability of winning. Use the data in training set to train a model and use the model to predict the Win Place Percentage in the testing set.
